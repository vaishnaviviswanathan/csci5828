<p style="text-align:center"><b>HISTORY</b></p>

<p>
The Machine code was the first programming paradigm which was introduced in
the earlier days. Assembly language (mnemonics and symbolic labels were used
to represent machine instruction and memory addresses)
was used for coding. These languages are also called the first and 
second generation languages.
</p>

<p>
Then came the Procedural languages. They had routines, subroutines, methods
and functions. One of the commonly known programming language,C, is a procedural 
language. These are also called the second generation programming language.
The procedural programming uses procedures to operate on data structures.
</p>

<p>
Object Oriented language was the next paradigm which was introduced. It involved 
creating objects which interacted in defined ways. Programming language C++, Java ,
C# are examples of an Object Oriented language.
</p>

<p>
Then came the declarative programming paradigms. Ex:SQL. They are also called the 
fourth generation languages. They tell the computer WHAT the program 
should do instead of specifying HOW the program should do it i.e they describe
their desired results without listing the commands required to achieve it.
</p>

<p>
Imperative works in contrast to the declarative programming language. Procedural
Programming is an imperative programming paradigm.  
</p>

<p>
FUNCTIONAL and LOGICAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS fall under DECLARATIVE 
PROGRAMMING paradigm.
