<p><b>(II) Abstraction:</b></p>

<p>Abstraction involves managing complexity in computer systems. It enables the user to interact with a class or a function at a higher level and suppresses unnecessary details. Essentially, the user has an interface with which he interacts with the elements and is not concerned with representation and implementation details below that interface.</p>

<b> Example:</b>

<p>Consider the Area method in the previous example. We can just call Rectangle.Area and do not need to know the exact formula for the area. Area acts as a black box that takes in the length and the breadth and outputs the rectangle area.</p>

<p><b>(III) Encapsulation:</b></p>
<p>Encapsulation enables combining data and functions into a single entity. Additionally, it involves access restriction to the inner working of the class. It is roughly similar to abstraction in information hiding. It reduces dependencies and collisions between pieces of code.</p>

<b>Example:</b>
<pre><code>
int x,y
d = distance(x,y)
</pre></code>
