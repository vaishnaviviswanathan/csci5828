<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"><b>FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</b></p>

<p>
In this paradigm, a problem is divided into functions. 
Functions are nothing but blocks of code with a name. 
They are capable of performing a particular task when invoked. 
They just compute what they are told to and are not bothered with the steps around them.
</p>

<p>
Functional programming languages can be either pure or impure. 
Pure functional languages are the ones which do not have any other way to program paradigm
mixed with functional style.Impure functional programming languages can have some influences
from other programming paradigms.
</p>

<p>
Some pure functional programming languages are :
</p>

* Haskell
* Hope
* Mercury
* Miranda

Some impure functional programming languages are :

* C#
* Curve
* Groovy
* Erlang
 
<b>Example - python</b>

<pre>
<code>

def fizbuz(n):
'''
Print FizzBuzz when n is a multiple of 3 and 5
Print Fizz when n is a multiple of only 3 and not 5
Print Buzz when n is a multiple of 5 and not 3
'''
    i = 0
    while(i < n+1) :
        if i%3==0 or i%5==0:
            if i%3 ==0 and i%5!=0:
                print "Fizz"
            elif i%3 !=0 and i%5==0:
                print "Buzz"

            elif i%3==0 and i%5==0:
                print "FizzBuzz"
        i+=1

def main():
    n = 100
    fizbuz(n)

main()
