<p><b>(IV) Inheritance:</b></p>
<p>Inheritance is a means of avoiding repetition when we have several classes sharing similar behaviors. Suppose we have class p. We want to create a class c which has all the behaviors of class p and some additional ones. Then, p is called the parent class and c is called the child class. Inheritance is generally defined by “is a” relationship. A Mercedes Class inherits from a Car Class because a Mercedes is a Car. Suppose we have a class Person with name and phone number as attributes. We want to create another class Student with name, phone number and Student ID as attributes. We can implement this in such a way that Student inherits from Person since name and phone number are shared attributes. Then, Student ID can be added. Here, Person is the parent class and Student is the child class. </p>
