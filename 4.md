<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"><b>IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</b></p>
			
<p>
In Imperative Programming, the programmer knows the formula or the steps to be followed to solve a problem. He instructs the program to follow those steps to get what he wants in return. </p>

<p>Some of the languages that use Imperative Programming Paradigm are:  </p>        
 
* Machine Level Languages
* Fortran
* ALGOL
* BASIC

<p><b>Example code in JAVASCRIPT to multiply elements of an array by 2</b></p>

<pre><code>
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
var doubled = []

for(var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) 
{
  var newNumber = numbers[i] * 2
  doubled.push(newNumber)
}
console.log(doubled) //=> [2,4,6,8,10]
</code></pre>
