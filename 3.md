<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"><b>LOGICAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</b></p>
			
<p>								
Logic programming is a programming paradigm based on formal logic. 
A logic program is a set of instructions that model facts and rules about the problem. 
It is analogous to translation of problems in terms of digital logic. 
Logic programming works well in exhaustive searches since it involves automatic backtracking for problems
</p>


<p>Some languages which can be programmed in Logical Paradigm:</p>
* Prolog
* Datalog
* ROOP
* ASP

<p>
Algorithms in logic programming are a combination of logic(determines solutions) and control
(determines alternate ways of execution)
</p>
 
<b>Example in Prolog to calculate fibonacci series:</b>

<pre><code>
fib(1, 1).
fib(2, 1).
fib(X, Y):-
       X > 1,
       X1 is X - 1,
       X2 is X - 2,
       fib(X1, Z),
       fib(X2, W),
       Y is W + Z.
main :-
  fib(6,X), write(X), nl.

</pre></code>
