<p><b>(V) Polymorphism:</b></p>
<p>Polymorphism implies “many forms”. It is a feature by which a single interface can be used for different purposes. Essentially, it lets us do the right thing at the right time. It is of two types: </p> 

>1.Compile time polymorphism

>2.Run time polymorphism
 
<p><b>Compile time polymorphism:</b></p>
<p>It involves early binding, static binding or static linking. The object is bound to the function call at compile time. It is implemented through function and operator overloading.</p>
 
<p><b>Run time polymorphism:</b></p>
<p>It involves dynamic binding or late binding. Objects of the derived class are treated as if they are the objects of base class. The function and the object are not linked till run time. It is achieved through virtual functions.</p>

<b>Example Snippet in Python:</b>
<pre><code>
n1 = 5
n2 = 8
t1 = Time(7,43)
t2 = Time(7,41)
t3 = Time(7,37)
totalNumber = sum([n1,n2])
totalTime = sum([t1,t2,t3])
</pre></code>
<p> In the above example, totalNumber returns 8 and totalTime returns 23:01:00. The sum function is polymorphic here.</p>
