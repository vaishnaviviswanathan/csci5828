<b>What is a Programming Paradigm?</b>

<p>
Programming paradigm is a style of programming a language.
The word paradigm is from the Greek word “paradeigma” which means a group sharing a characteristic.
Paradigm depicts a thought pattern followed to achieve a specification given.
Programming Paradigm indicates the style or the way a programmer thinks to solve a programming problem. 
This style is a notational form that can be read by both the machine and the human. 
Hence, it is nothing but a standard programming procedure followed to achieve a task.
</p>

Some of the programming paradigms which were developed over time are,

* Imperative
* Declarative
* Functional
* Object-Oriented
* Procedural
*  Logic

There are many programming languages which supports either a single paradigm or multiple paradigms.In this presentation we discuss about the most used paradigms; Logical,Imperative,Functional,Procedural,Object-Oriented.
