<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"><b>PROCEDUARAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</b></p>

<p>
In Procedure Oriented Programming paradigm, the problems are solved by concentrating on how to do things.
They are based on procedures, which are also known as routines. We instruct the program how to operate 
on the data, but the data is given lesser importance. Hence, the data is said to be decoupled from the 
functions which operate on it. In Procedural Programming, data moves freely throughout the program. 
Hence, every modification reflects throughout the program. The problem here is not modelled in terms of 
a real world problem.

<p>Some programming languages that use Procedural Paradigm are:</p>

<p> 1. Go </p>
<p> 2. Pascal </p>
<p> 3. Bliss </p>
<p> 4. Blue </p>


<b>Example in Pascal - Calculating Fibonacci series:</b>

<pre><code>
function fib(n: Integer): Integer;
var a: Integer = 1;
    b: Integer = 1;
    f: Integer;
    i: Integer;
begin
  if (n = 1) or (n = 2) then
     fib := 1
  else
    begin
      for i := 3 to n do
      begin
         f := a + b;
         b := a;
         a := f;
      end;
      fib := f;
    end;
end;

begin
  WriteLn(fib(6));
end.
